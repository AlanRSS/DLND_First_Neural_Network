# DLND_First_Neural_Network

This is a project of the Deep Learning Nanodegree, it is my first challenge into the world of building a neural network. The neural network was used to predict the bike rental ridership, and it has some graphs that display the accuracy of the neural network for predicting the case presented.

## Tecnology Stack

This project is built using Python, Anaconda, Numpy, matplotlib and pandas.


## How to run
To check out the project download the files and open the html page, In case you are interested on changing and playing around with the notebook run it on jupyter notebooks. Have fun!
